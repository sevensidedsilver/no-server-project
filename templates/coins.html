      <h2>Litecoin (LTC)</h2>
      <p>Introduced to the market in 2011, Litecoin was inspired by, and is nearly technically identical to, Bitcoin. It's actually a fork of Bitcoin - differening only by having a decreased block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a new hashing algorithm.</p>
